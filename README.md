# GRIPInternship_Task1
In this task, I was presented with a challenging problem: Predicting the percentage of a student based on the number of hours they have studied. Armed with a sample dataset, I embarked on the journey of data exploration and analysis.
Here's a snapshot of my journey:
1️. Data Preprocessing: I started by cleaning and preparing the dataset, ensuring it was ready for the model-building phase.
2️. Model Training and Testing: Using Python, I split the dataset into training and testing sets, a crucial step in evaluating the model's performance.
3️. Model Building: Leveraging the power of Simple Linear Regression, I constructed a robust model that could predict the student's percentage based on their study hours.
4️. Predictive Magic: With the model in place, I put it to the test and successfully predicted the desired results with precision and accuracy.
